        <h3>Language skills</h3>
        <p>My mother-tongue is Persian and as an Iranian girl, I master French an English. I have been teaching these two languages for more than 5 years now. I have translation experiences as well and have worked as a freelance translator in literary, historical and psychological fields. I have also translated a French novel into Persian. Since my passion for learning languages never seems to have an ending, I have also started learning Spanish and I have an intermediate (B1) level in it.</p>

        <h3>Computer & Programing skills</h3>
        <p>
          I have learnt front-end programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript up to an advanced level. I have UI Design skills and I can work with Adobe-Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, etc. During the courses that I have passed with highly professional teachers from the US and the UK, I have gained a lot of UX Design skills and Project-Management abilities. I am also learning to work and develop web-applications and smart-robots using Python. I find myself very talented at this field and highly creative in what at do. I am the sort of person who never stops learning.</p>

        <p>Since I was a little girl, I have always had a magical connection with languages in my head. I have have always loved literature, poetry and the way we are able to incarnate our feelings inside the others' minds. I have been writing poems in persian and in English since I was 14.
